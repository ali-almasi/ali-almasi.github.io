    Spotify has shared the `annoy` library for nearest-neighbor calculations.
    However, trying to install it on Windows can give cryptic errors if python does not have access to the latest C compiler.
    In this post, I tell you how to fix this issue.

# Installation errors for annoy

When trying to install [the annoy python library](https://pypi.org/project/annoy/), you might encounter a cryptic error like: `error: command 'gcc'. failed with exit status 1`
This error is due to python not having access to the latest C compiler.

When searching for a solution to this problem, I found many poor solutions which instead advised to use pre-compiled versions. Please, please, please never use random compiled code from unvetted third parties: that's a major security risk!
Instead, this error is very easy to fix: we just have to install the latest version of the C compiler.

# Installing the C compiler on Windows

Microsoft provides [a download link for the C++ build tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/).
This actually downloads an installer util which will itself install the build tools:

1. Download the file from the Microsoft website.
1. Run it.
1. Among the many installation options, select the latest version *Visual Studio Build Tools* (at the time of this writing, 2022).

And done! You should now be able to install annoy:

```
pip install annoy
```

When installing python packages, please keep in mind the good practice of creating a separate environment for each project.
I recommend using the built-in `venv` util for this, and accessing it via the VSCode command line.
