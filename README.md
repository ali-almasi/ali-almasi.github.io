# Guillaume Dehaene personal website with Quarto

This project is used to construct my [personal website](https://www.guillaumedehaene.com) using [Quarto](https://www.quarto.org).

All content on the website is my copyright and I give you no permission to reproduce it and publish it.

However, feel free to reproduce the structure of the website, to copy fragments of my markdown code and to re-use parts of my style file.
